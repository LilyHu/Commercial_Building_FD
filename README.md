Import, clean, and prepare data for machine learning for fault detection in commercial building HVAC chiller system. 

The raw data is from <a href='https://www.modelica.org/'>a physics-based simulation program</a> of a commercial building chiller plant, a complex physical systems containing mechanical, electrical, thermal, and control subcomponents. 

The code processes this raw data into design matrices and label matrices for machine learning.
